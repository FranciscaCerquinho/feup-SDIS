## [Distributed Backup Service](https://web.fe.up.pt/~pfs/aulas/sd2018/projs/proj1/proj1.html)
In this project we develop a distributed backup service for a local area network (LAN). The idea is to use the free disk space of the computers in a LAN for backing up files in other computers in the same LAN. The service is provided by servers in an environment that is assumed cooperative (rather than hostile). Nevertheless, each server retains control over its own disks and, if needed, may reclaim the space it made available for backing up other computers' files.

## How to compile

The project can be compiled using the *javac* command.
```
$ javac *.java
```
### RMI registry
In order to start the `rmiregistry`, use the following command

On windows:

```
$ rmiregistry 
```

On linux:

```
$ rmiregistry &
```
### Peer

To start a peer, use the following command as an example:

```
$ java Peer <PeerID>
```
Where `<PeerID>` is a number that corresponds to the id of a peer.

### To start the App

The ```<RMI obj. name>``` must be the same as the one used when the *Peer* we intended to connect this *App* with was launched.
```
$ java App <RMI obj. name> backup <file path> <replicationDegree>
$ java App <RMI obj. name> delete <file path>
$ java App <RMI obj. name> restore <file path>
$ java App <RMI obj. name> reclaim <amount of space>
$ java App <RMI obj. name> state
```
Example:
Your App is supposed to trigger the backup of file test1.pdf with a replication degree of 3. Likewise, by invoking:

```
$ java App 1 backup test1.pdf 3
```
